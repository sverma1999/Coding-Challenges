# Challange
Showcase my Python skills by tackling a data wrangling challenge that involves the open library public data API.

# Tasks:
    1. Parse Available Datasets
    2. Retrieve a Specific Dataset
    3. Brief Dataset Exploration

**Additional task:**
Implement error handling in my script to gracefully handle any issues encountered by either the API or subsequently collected data

# Deliverable:
    I will write a script / notebook demonstrating the tasks mentioned above.


**This challenge will assess my ability to interact with APIs, parse data, and perform basic data exploration using Python.**
